			Every day, another hatch will become available, containing money, an item, a vehicle or something else. All hatches belonging to a previous date will be available. Once a hatch has been opened, you must claim it in order to receive it. Opening and collecting will become impossible after the 25th of December.
			<br><br>
			Next hatch unlocks in ${time}.
			<br><br>
			Opening a hatch on the day it was unlocked, gives you a bonus point. If you obtain enough bonus points, you will receive a special gift on the 24th of December. (The bonus gift must be claimed before the 26th.)
