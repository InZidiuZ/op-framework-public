# op-framework-public
A repository to store and modify language and config files for OP-FW servers and clusters. You can find a full documentation of all available config parameters [here](https://docs.opfw.net/config).

# Changing Files
To make changes to the files, make a pull request and wait for approval. PRs that include files bound to specific clusters will only be approved if it was made by the cluster's manager. If you are wanting to edit your config and there's no conifg file for your cluster, create one following the layout of an already existing one.
